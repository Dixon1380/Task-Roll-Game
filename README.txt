A roll die game based on a To Do list or list of tasks you have to complete but unsure where to start. 
This game helps when you are not sure what you want to do first. It forces you to do something without procastinating or when you are overwhelmed. 

--------Rules--------
           - You get a total of 6 rules (5 tasks + 1 Free Pass)\n
           - Free Pass always the last task added to the list
           - You can add up to 1 task at a time. 
           - Once you added all of your task, you get to assign them based on priority.
           - You get to assigned them based on a range of (1,6) where 1 is less important and 6 is most important
           - Once you assigned your task, you are ready to roll!
           - You only get to roll one die! 
           - Whichever number you land on, that's the task you have to complete. 
           - Once you complete that task, you roll again until you are out of tasks.
